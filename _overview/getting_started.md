Ever wanted to be able to control a device with simple English?

Look how easy it is with the Open Source Timer and Timer Description Language:

You'll succeed if you do this.
{: .success }

Here's some useful information.
{: .info }

Something may not happen if you try and do this.
{: .warning }

Something bad will happen if you do this.
{: .error }
