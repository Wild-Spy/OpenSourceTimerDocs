title: Rule Names
position: 1.1

Rule names can contain only _underscores, capital and lower case letters_ and numbers and _must start with a letter_.  
1. If the rule starts with a capital letter eg. `MyRule` then it will be enabled on startup.  
2. If the rule starts with a lower case letter eg. `myRule` then it will be disabled on startup.

Rule names are not case sensitive so `myrule` and `MyRuLe` are considered the same rule
